A simple python vibe-coded script to show the usage of your [Neon](https://neon.com) projects and databases.

This includes month-to-date values as well as a forecast **guesstimate** of what the end-of-month fee may be.

> This is VERY simple and assumes the standard **Launch** plan on Neon. A lot is vibe-hard-coded, so use at your own risk! (although I did attempt to make it useful and workable)
